# Poetry GraphQL API

Built to teach myself about how to use GraphQL with Rails.

So far, only supports querying.

Here are some examples, though:

### Getting Authors by last name:

### Getting titles of poems authors have written:

### Getting the lines of each poem:

### You can also get line numbers!


# Getting started

Sorry this is sparse, but just, for now:

* `rails db:migrate` to set up the schema,
* `rails db:seed` to set up the testing data
